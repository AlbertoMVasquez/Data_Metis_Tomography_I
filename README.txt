CONTENTS of REPOSITORY:

The data corresponds to 3D-tomographic-reconstructions and 3D-MHD simulations of the Solar Physics article "Tomography of the Solar Corona with the Metis Coronagraph I: Predictive Simulations with Visible Light Images". Each 3D cube of data is specified on a uniform spherical grid, as described in the IDL codes that allow reading the cubes into memory. The specific products contained in this repository are:

* Electron density of the 3D-MHD steady-state AWSoM simulations for periods CR 2082 and 2152.

* Electron density reconstructed by SRT for periods CR 2082 and 2152. For each period three reconstructions are included, corresponding to synthetic data producedd along three orbital segments: aphelion, perihelion and solar-maximum-latitude. A total of six reconstructions are then provided.

* Time series of synthetic images used for the six numerical reconstructions, in FITS format. These are located in sub-directories: ./SYNTH_IMAGES*/

INSTRUCTIONS: The IDL script included contains comments describing how to read into memory the data.
