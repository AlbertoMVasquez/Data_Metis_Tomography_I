CONTENTS of REPOSITORY:

The shared data corresponds to 3D tomographic reconstructions and 3D MHD simulations of the article "Tomography of the Solar Corona with the Metis Coronagraph I: Predictive Simulations with Visible Light Images". Each 3D cube of data is specified in a uniform spherical grid, as described in the IDL codes that allow reading the cubes into memory. The specific shared products are: 

3D MHD steady-state simulations using the AWSoM model:
   * Electron density used to make the synthetic images to perform Solar Rotational Tomography (SRT).

3D Tomographic reconstructions:
   * Electron density reconstructed by SRT, for Aphelion, Perihelion, and Maximum Solar Latitude period (for solar maximum and minimum, respectively).

Time series of synthetic images for the six numerical experiments in FITS format (./SYNTH_IMAGES_.../ directories).
   
   
INSTRUCTIONS: The IDL script included contains comments describing how to read into memory the data.
